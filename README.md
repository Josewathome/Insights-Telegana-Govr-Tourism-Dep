# Project Title: Telangana Government Tourism Analysis

### Project Summary:

In the "Telangana Government Tourism Analysis" project, our goal was to gain valuable insights from tourism data in the Telangana state of India. We aimed to prepare, analyze, and interpret this data to provide actionable recommendations to the Telangana government. The primary objectives of the project included:

Data Preparation: We began by collecting and preparing the data for analysis. This involved importing relevant libraries and loading data from multiple CSV files. We focused on two datasets: one for domestic visitors and another for foreign visitors.

Data Merging: We consolidated the data from 2016 to 2019 to create comprehensive datasets for both domestic and foreign visitors. The data was merged and stored in separate CSV files for further analysis.

Data Cleaning: We cleaned the data by addressing missing values and ensuring data consistency. For instance, we filled missing values in the domestic visitors dataset with zeros.

### Data Analysis:

We identified the top and bottom districts in terms of the highest and lowest number of domestic visitors.
We calculated the compounded annual growth rates (CAGR) of visitors for each district, enabling us to identify the top and bottom districts in terms of CAGR.
We determined the peak and low seasons for select districts.
We analyzed the domestic-to-foreign tourist ratio for districts to identify the top and bottom districts in this regard.
Projection and Revenue Estimation:

We projected the number of domestic and foreign visitors for a specified district in 2025 based on historical growth rates.
We estimated the revenue for these projected visitor counts by using average revenue figures for domestic and foreign tourists.
Potential for Tourism Growth:

We identified districts with the highest potential for tourism growth. These districts showed promising CAGR figures, suggesting opportunities for tourism development.
Relevant Code Examples:

Python code

            # Data Preparation
            import pandas as pd
            import numpy as np
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            import seaborn as sns
            
            # Data Loading
            domestic_2016 = pd.read_csv("C5 Input for participants\domestic_visitors\domestic_visitors_2016.csv")
            domestic_2017 = pd.read_csv("C5 Input for participants\domestic_visitors\domestic_visitors_2017.csv")
            
            # Merging Data
            domestic_visitors = pd.concat([domestic_2016, domestic_2017], axis=0, ignore_index=True)
            
            # Data Cleaning
            domestic_visitors['visitors'] = domestic_visitors['visitors'].fillna(0)
            
            # Data Analysis
            # Identify the top and bottom districts based on visitors, calculate CAGR, and more.
            
            # Projection and Revenue Estimation
            # Estimate future visitor counts and revenue for a specified year.

### Recommendations:

District Development: Focus on developing districts like Komaram Bheem Asifabad and Mulugu, which show the highest CAGR in domestic visitors, and capitalize on their growth potential.

Promote Peak Seasons: Leverage the insights on peak and low seasons to promote and manage tourism more effectively. For example, target marketing and special events in the low seasons to attract more visitors.

Revenue Enhancement: Recognize the potential revenue from tourism and allocate resources for infrastructure, marketing, and facilities to maximize revenue in the districts with the highest potential.

Foreign Visitor Expansion: Work on promoting tourism to districts like Mancherial, Mulugu, and Narayanapet to attract foreign visitors. These districts have untapped potential.

Data Enrichment: For more accurate projections and recommendations, consider including district population data in the analysis.

## The "Telangana Government Tourism Analysis" project provides a valuable roadmap for the Telangana government to make informed decisions and boost the tourism sector's contribution to the state's economy.
